# Editor and IDE

I began by trying to setup the eclipse IDE, but this proved just a bit too unreliable as
building and flashing to the board would never work. I was able to easily use the msys32 
command line to edit code in vim and then flash to the board. I found that I could more
easily edit code using sublime text and just pulling up the files outside the msys terminal
for writing. Then I can just save and go back to the terminal to build/flash. For new projects
I simply have the stock project template provided on the esp api guide site and copy/paste 
for new projects. To upload to github I copy the project file into the relevant are in my personal
github repo.
